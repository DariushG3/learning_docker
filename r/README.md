## README

One can simply use `apt-get install -y r-base` if you don't require an R version later than `R version 3.0.2 (2013-09-25) -- "Frisbee Sailing"`. The `ubuntu` version is Precise Pangolin (12.04) and [as noted](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/): "R 3.3.0 and above is not supported for Precise Pangolin (12.04; LTS), but previous builds will remain here until end of life for 12.04." The `ontologyIndex` package required R (â‰¥ 3.1.0), hence this Dockerfile that installs a lot of libraries required to compile R. The Docker image created from this Dockerfile was 1.334 GB.

Build:

~~~~{.bash}
